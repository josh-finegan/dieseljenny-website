Diesel Jenny launches their debut release, a double A-side as part of their new white label series. The ferociously rungle two-tracker is the first trip out under a new moniker from veteran P≈çneke-based producer Josh Finegan (fka ABG). With a back catalogue of break-heavy club tools and blown-out emotional heaters via underground mainstays Big Fresh Collective and Bankrupt Records, DJEN001 marks both a clean start and a continuation.
